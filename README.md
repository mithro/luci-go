Installing
----------

    go get -u github.com/luci/luci-go/client/cmd/...
    go get -u github.com/luci/luci-go/server/cmd/...

There is a [`quickstart.sh`](quickstart.sh) script which can be used to get all
the needed dependencies.


 You can use it like;

    wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luci/luci-go/master/quicksetup.sh | bash


Code layout
-----------

  * [/appengine/...](https://github.com/luci/luci-go/tree/master/appengine)
    contains [AppEngine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/) server
    code. It imports packages from `/common/...` and `/server/...`.
  * [/client/...](https://github.com/luci/luci-go/tree/master/client) contains
    all client code.
  * [/common/...](https://github.com/luci/luci-go/tree/master/common) contains
    code and structures shared between all of `/appengine/...`, `/client/...`
    and `/server/...`; for example, the structures used by the server APIs.
    These are inherently APIs.
  * [/server/...](https://github.com/luci/luci-go/tree/master/server) contains
    standalone server code. Its packages are reusable by `/appengine/...`.
  * [/tools/...](https://github.com/luci/luci-go/tree/master/tools) contains
    support tools used by other LUCI components.


Versioning
----------

  * Branch `go1` contains the stable code.
  * Branch `master` constains the latest code.
